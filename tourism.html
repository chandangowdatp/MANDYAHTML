  Hemagiri in K.R.Pet Taluk, about six miles from K.R.Pet Town, is on the bank of the river Hemavati. The left bank of the river has a continuous strip of grand and fascinating foliage. Many people frequent this place for rest and recuperation. An anicut is constructed at the foot of the hill across the Hemavati river here and is called the Hemagiri anicut, from where channels are drawn for irrigation purposes.
