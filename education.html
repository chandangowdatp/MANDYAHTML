  <h2>Education Scenario in Mandya District</h2><br>



                The education scenario in Mandya district was very bleak up to the end of 70’s.  Due to the lack of schools and colleges, people were hesitant to send their wards to the distant schools and colleges.  Of late, the senior politicians and philanthropists took initiative in establishing private schools and colleges in the remote parts of the district. <br>

                With the implementation of total literacy campaign and the post-literacy program in the early 90’s, awareness was created in the entire district about the importance of literacy.  With the DPEP program a total  transformation is seen among the villagers in particular and people of the district in general.<br><br><br>

<h2>TOTAL LITERACY CAMPAIGN</h2><br>

                Mandya district was having 41%  literacy as per 1991 census report.  It occupied the 17th place in the literacy map of the state.  The  Total Literacy Campaign was approved by the Executive Committee of National Literacy Mission authority on  5th November 1990.  The  responsibility of the campaign was entrusted to a registered organisation “Sakshara Jyothi ®” consisting of representatives of voluntary organisations, people'’ representatives, social workers and government officers.<br>

                The objective of the Campaign was to make all the illiterates in the age group 9-35, functionally literate and to create awareness among them. It was also aimed to strengthen the base of primary education and to provide base for continuing education.   As per survey conducted the illiterate adults in the age group 9-35 were 4.1 lakh in the district.  During the original survey about 50,000 active volunteers were identified, comprehensive training was  provided to these volunteers and also to other functionaries like Resource Persons, District Taluks and Mandal level co-ordinators, Master Trainers, Kala Jatha artists etc.,<br>

                An Executive Committee was constituted to guide and look after the day-to-day work of the campaign.  The Executive Committee was assisted by different sub-committees.  Sakshara Jyothi has brought out 3 graded primers for use in these learning centers.  Well known writers and Artists participated in a script writing workshop.  They brought out street plays, songs, dramas with the following themes; literacy, awareness and functionality, National Integration, Education against alcoholism, Equality of women, Democratic values, savings habit, protection of environment etc., The cultural jatha was inaugurated on 15th July 1991 and contained  up to 14th September 191 in the first phase.  The learning centers were started on 15th September 1991, which happens to be the birthday of Bharath Ratna Sir.M.Visweswaraya.<br>

                Internal evaluation was conducted on 21st September 1992 and 18th January 1993.  The total neo literate as per the internal evaluation was 2.9 lakh which works out to be 78% of the targeted number.<br>

                External summative evaluation of neo literate was done by Indian Social Institute of Bangalore, from 6ht October 1993 to 13th October 1993.  The achievement recorded by them is 82%. <br><br><br>

<h2>POST LITERACY PROGRAMME:</h2><br>

                The Post Literacy Programme was launched in the district on 15th August 1992. It was proposed that about 3.5 lakh neo literate would join the Jana Chaitanya Kendras (JCK) to avail the benefits of post literacy programme. 4263 JCKS were organised.  Of these 500 centers were managed by Nehru Yuvak Kendras.  There were 200 Urdu Kendras.  The Guides and Associate Guides who were managing these Kendras on voluntary service basis were given comprehensive Training.   Post literacy program primer was designed and got printed (Savi Sudha).  A work shop for writers for preparation of supplementary reading materials was conducted.  A weekly broad sheet “Savi Suddi” was being published and supplied to all JCKS.<br><br><br><br>
